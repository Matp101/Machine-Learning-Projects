# Machine Learning Projects

This is my repository for all the machine learning projects I have worked on. The projects are divided into the following categories:
1. [Nural Networks](#nn)
2. [Convolutional Neural Networks](#cnn)
3. [Natural Language Processing](#nlp)
4. [Deep Neural Networks](#dnn)

## Nural Networks <a name="nn"></a>
Both of the projects in this category are from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The first project is a classification problem, and the second is a regression problem.
### [Project 1](comp3710-group-project-1/README.md) Prisoner Delima
### [Project 2](comp3710-group-project-2/README.md) Classification and Regression

## Convolutional Neural Networks <a name="cnn"></a>
The projects in this category are from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) website. The first project is a classification problem, and the second is a classification problem.
### [Project 1](4730-Project-I/README.md) MNIST Dataset
### [Project 2](4740-Project-II/README.md) CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Natural Language Processing <a name="nlp"></a>
This project is from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) website. The project is a sentiment analysis problem.
### [Project 1](4730-Project-II/README.md) Sentiment Analysis

## Deep Neural Networks <a name="dnn"></a>
This project is from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The project is a classification problem.
### [Project 1](4740-Project-I/README.md) Classification
